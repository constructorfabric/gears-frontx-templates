**ID**: `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-adr-calendar-kit-packaging`

## Context and Problem Statement

`@gears-frontx/calendar-kit` is the calendar UI component library of the `template-calendar` feature template: the installable React package through which host applications embed calendar views with their own data and permission model. Its package versions are published from this template repo, and applying the template may copy its source into a consumer as that consumer's owned starting point. Its visual units need design-system controls — button, checkbox, combobox, calendar, field, input, radio group, select, textarea, switch — and the ecosystem already publishes exactly those in `@gears-frontx/ui-kit`. How should the package relate to ui-kit: take it as a declared dependency, or hold zero intra-ecosystem edges and carry its own controls?

## Decision Drivers

* Exact-pinned intra-ecosystem edge — `@gears-frontx/ui-kit` stays a runtime dependency at the exact registry pin (`0.4.0-alpha.5`), so a ui-kit upgrade is a calendar-kit change the bump-on-change gate sees, never a silent drift.
* Primitives-only import boundary — only `src/ui/primitives/` imports `@gears-frontx/ui-kit`; family units, the React layer and the core never do, so the depended surface is the wrapped set, not the whole kit.
* React-free core as a directory boundary — the pure model and algorithms stay in `src/core` with no React, no ui-kit and no JSX, deferring a separate core package while the property holds.
* ESM-only, source maps shipped — following the ui-kit precedent: ECMAScript-module output only, `sourcemap: true`, with `dist/docs` and the agent index shipping inside the artifact.
* Template package — a calendar is a concrete feature, not framework-level functionality, so the package lives in the `template-calendar` template (gears-frontx-templates), not in the ecosystem repository. It is bound to React 19 by peer range and to ui-kit by the single allowed edge, with no other new edge.

## Considered Options

* **One installable artifact with a pinned ui-kit dependency behind package-local primitives** — the package declares the exact-pinned `@gears-frontx/ui-kit` runtime edge, wraps the used controls in `src/ui/primitives/`, ships ESM with source maps, and discovers family-unit entries from `src/**/public.ts` at build time.
* **Zero intra-ecosystem edges with forked or re-implemented controls** — the package carries no ecosystem dependency and re-implements or vendors every control it renders, holding `standalone: true`.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **One installable artifact with a pinned ui-kit dependency behind package-local primitives**, because the controls already exist in the ecosystem with their behaviour and accessibility, and re-implementing them would create the second drifting control set the package exists to prevent for calendars. The pin makes the coupling explicit and reviewable: a ui-kit release never reaches a calendar consumer except through a calendar-kit version that names it.

### Consequences

* Good, because the package renders controls whose behaviour and accessibility already hold, instead of owning a parallel control set.
* Good, because the primitives boundary keeps the depended surface minimal and greppable — one directory to audit for the whole edge.
* Good, because the exact pin plus the bump-on-change gate makes every ui-kit upgrade a visible calendar-kit release decision.
* Bad, because a host on a different ui-kit line receives two ui-kit copies; hosts align on the pinned line or accept the duplication.
* Bad, because the package is not standalone: it cannot release independently of ui-kit's availability on the registry.

### Confirmation

Confirmed the same way the package's other boundaries are confirmed: the boundary guards report exactly one intra-ecosystem edge in the manifest and import graph (`calendar-kit -> ui-kit`), a source scan reports zero `@gears-frontx/ui-kit` imports outside `src/ui/primitives/`, and the published artifact resolves every family-unit entry with declarations under both `bundler` and `nodenext`.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### One installable artifact with a pinned ui-kit dependency behind package-local primitives

The package declares `@gears-frontx/ui-kit` at the exact registry pin, imports it only from `src/ui/primitives/`, and ships one ESM artifact with source maps, family-unit subpath entries, and the docs/agent index.

* Good, because no control behaviour is duplicated between the two packages.
* Good, because the edge is a single declared, pinned, mechanically checked dependency rather than an informal import.
* Neutral, because a ui-kit upgrade always costs a calendar-kit release, even when the calendar surface is untouched.
* Bad, because hosts that cannot align on the pinned ui-kit line carry two copies of it.

### Zero intra-ecosystem edges with forked or re-implemented controls

The package vendors or rewrites every control it renders and declares no ecosystem dependency.

* Good, because the package would release on its own line with no coupling at all.
* Bad, because every control fix would land twice, in two packages with two test suites — the exact drift the calendar package exists to end, recreated one layer down.
* Bad, because it contradicts the layer's own reuse property: a published library that cannot depend on another published library.

## More Information

**Scope of impact.** Governs only how `@gears-frontx/calendar-kit` relates to `@gears-frontx/ui-kit` and how it ships: the single allowed edge, the primitives-only import boundary, the React-free core directory boundary, and the ESM-with-sourcemaps artifact shape. It does not decide the package's version line, its export map entries, or its theme contract — those live in the manifest, the build plugin, and the member DESIGN.

**Review trigger.** Revisit if the depended ui-kit surface grows past the wrapped set (new direct imports outside primitives), or if the core's no-React property fails and forces the separate-package extraction this boundary defers.

**Checklist applicability.**

* ARCH — applicable and addressed above (a hard-to-reverse coupling decision binding every calendar consumer to a ui-kit line).
* SEC — Not applicable because this decision moves no trust boundary: it reuses already-published controls rather than introducing a credential, authorization, or data-handling concern.
* PERF — Not applicable because a declared dependency on the same controls carries no different runtime cost than vendored copies of them at the volumes this package operates at.
* REL — Not applicable because it governs a compile-time/import-graph edge, not runtime availability or fault tolerance.
* DATA — Not applicable because no persistent data store or schema is involved.
* INT — applicable: the ui-kit edge is itself an integration contract between two published members; its shape (exact pin, primitives-only imports) is owned by this package going forward, and a breaking change to the wrapped surface is scoped the same way the member release policy scopes any breaking change.
* OPS — Not applicable because no deployed-service operational procedure is governed by this decision.
* MAINT — applicable: the pinned edge keeps the calendar package's own blast radius bounded to one directory when the wrapped controls change, at the cost that every ui-kit upgrade requires a calendar-kit release, noted above.

## Traceability

- **PRD**: [../PRD.md](../PRD.md)
- **DESIGN**: [../DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-fr-installable-artifact` — one installable versioned artifact adopted by dependency declaration is the decided shape.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-nfr-react-free-core` — the React-free core directory boundary is what the separate-package extraction defers to.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-nfr-independent-versioning` — the exact pin behind the primitives is what keeps a calendar-only change releaseable on its own line.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-nfr-tree-shakeable-units` — per-family entries with injected CSS keep the pinned edge from costing unimported families.
* `cpt-template-calendar-constraint-calendar-kit-no-solution-content` — the package ships generic creation UI (`CreateEventPopover`) driven by host callbacks; persistence, backend and scheduling rules stay with the host.
* `cpt-template-calendar-constraint-calendar-kit-react-free-core` — the core carries no React, ui-kit, or browser-global import.
* `cpt-template-calendar-constraint-calendar-kit-single-peer-edge` — ui-kit is the only intra-ecosystem UI edge, reached only through the primitives.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-component-ui-data-model` — the neutral model the host maps into before rendering.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-component-react-free-core` — the pure calculations the edge never touches.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-component-ui-family-units` — the per-family entries the artifact ships.
* `cpt-template-calendar-calendar-kit-component-theme-contract` — the token surface that keeps branding host-owned despite the shared controls.
