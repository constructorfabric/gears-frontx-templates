# EventDetailPanel

Event detail shell. With `anchorElement` it opens as a popover beside the event card, the way calendar apps preview an event. Its expand control grows it into a two-column dialog the size of the expanded create-event popover, with the details on the start side and every invitee, grouped by response, on the end side. Collapse shrinks it back. Without an anchor it opens as that dialog. The body shows date and time, location, organizer with email, conferencing (Join and Copy link), participants as overlapping avatars with RSVP counts, conflicts, a divider, time zones, and description. Edit and delete sit in the header and are left to the host through `onEdit`/`onDelete` or `renderActions`.

Import it from its own entry; the stylesheet arrives with the component:

```ts
import {
  EventDetailPanel,
  type EventDetailPanelProps,
} from "@gears-frontx/calendar-kit/event-detail-panel";
```

## Props

<!-- generated:props EventDetailPanelProps -->

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `onClose` | `() => void` | yes | Called by the close button, Escape and an outside press. |
| `anchorElement` | `HTMLElement` |  | Opens the detail as a popover beside this element, usually the card from `onEventSelect`. |
| `className` | `string` |  | Class added to the component root. |
| `comparisonTimeZone` | `IanaTimeZone` |  | Adds a second line with the event time in this zone. |
| `container` | `Element \| DocumentFragment` |  | Portal target for the popover or dialog, for example a node inside a shadow root. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` |  | Initial open state when uncontrolled. |
| `event` | `CalendarEvent` |  | The event to show. |
| `maxVisibleParticipants` | `number` |  | Avatars shown before the `+N` control. Default `6`. |
| `onDelete` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => void` |  | Shows the delete button. Hidden when `readOnly` or the event is busy. |
| `onEdit` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => void` |  | Shows the edit button. Hidden when `readOnly` or the event is busy. |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean) => void` |  | Called when the panel opens or closes. |
| `open` | `boolean` |  | Controlled open state. |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` |  | Hides edit and delete. |
| `renderActions` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => ReactNode` |  | Replaces the edit and delete buttons. |
| `renderBody` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => ReactNode` |  | Replaces the whole default body. |
| `renderFooter` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => ReactNode` |  | Content below the body, for example RSVP controls. |
| `renderHeader` | `(event: CalendarEvent \| null) => ReactNode` |  | Content below the header row. |
| `renderMetadata` | `(event: CalendarEvent) => ReactNode` |  | Host rows appended to the body. |
| `selectedEventId` | `string` |  | Id of the selected event, for host bookkeeping. |

Also accepts the shared props `direction`, `locale`, `messages`, `t`, `timeZone`, `translations`; see [Internationalization](../../docs/i18n.md#per-component-overrides).

## Anchored preview

The preview opens beside the card, on whichever side has room, with an arrow pointing at it; when neither side fits it opens below or above the card. Expand moves the same content into a dialog panel without a backdrop, and collapse returns it to the anchored preview. A newly selected event opens as the anchored preview again.

## Composition

The shell supplies the dialog semantics, Escape handling, outside-close handling, and the focus trap. Participant rows show a decorative avatar beside the attendee's name and email. The default copy action is a low-emphasis text button; the icon-only close button carries an accessible label.

## Safety and announcements

- Only `http(s)` join URLs become a link or a copy target; anything else fails closed (no link, no copy button, and no clipboard access).
- Copy success/failure is announced through a `role="status"` region using the resolved translator's `calendar.detail.copy.copied` and `calendar.detail.copy.failed` messages; the status returns to idle after `COPY_STATUS_RESET_MS`.
- Busy-access events hide details, participants, RSVP, join/copy, and terminal actions, showing only the range plus a restricted note.
- The panel renders the supplied event directly. It does not create loading, error, or empty-state shells; fetching and failure presentation remain host concerns.
- On close, focus returns to the element that was active when the panel opened, including an opener inside the supplied shadow root. The popover or dialog stays in the current tree unless an explicit `container` is supplied.

## Controller

`useEventDetailPanelController` (also exported from this entry) owns open state, copy status, participant capping, restriction, focus-origin capture, and terminal-action availability. Frozen result names: `isOpen`, `close`, `canCopyJoinLink`, `copyLink`, `copyStatus`, `visibleParticipants`, `participantOverflowCount`, `isRestricted`, `canEdit`, `canDelete`, `handleEdit`, `handleDelete`, plus the read-only `getInternals()` accessor. `COPY_STATUS_RESET_MS` (2000) is exported for consumers and tests.
