# CreateEventPopover

`CreateEventPopover` is a host-neutral create-event form. It accepts a neutral `CreateEventDraft`, injected calendar/resource options, a translation callback, an optional `now?: UtcInstant` reference instant, and an `onSubmit` callback; it does not call application APIs or create adapters.

The compact shell is an inline, shadow-root-safe dialog. `expanded` renders the same form as a centered window without a backdrop, with the title across the top and people in a side column, without replacing the controller or draft. Use `defaultDraft`/`defaultOpen`/`defaultExpanded` for uncontrolled usage, or pair the controlled props with their change callbacks.

## Props

<!-- generated:props CreateEventPopoverProps -->

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calendars` | `readonly CalendarRef[]` | yes | Calendars offered in the schedule field. |
| `conferencingProviders` | `readonly CalendarResourceOption[]` | yes | Conferencing providers offered in the conferencing select. |
| `locations` | `readonly CalendarResourceOption[]` | yes | Locations offered in the location combobox. |
| `onCancel` | `() => void` | yes | Called when the form closes without saving: a clean cancel, or a confirmed discard. |
| `onSubmit` | `(draft: CreateEventDraft) => Promise<CreateEventResult> \| undefined` | yes | Called with a valid draft; a returned `error` keeps the form open. |
| `people` | `readonly CalendarResourceOption[]` | yes | People offered in the people combobox. |
| `anchorRect` | `DOMRect` |  | Screen rectangle to place the compact popover beside, for example the quick-create cell. |
| `anchorRef` | `RefObject<HTMLElement \| null>` |  | Element to place the compact popover beside. Wins over `anchorRect`. |
| `className` | `string` |  | Class added to the component root. |
| `defaultDraft` | `CreateEventDraft` |  | Initial draft when uncontrolled. Also the baseline for the unsaved-changes check. |
| `defaultExpanded` | `boolean` |  | Initial expanded state when uncontrolled. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` |  | Initial open state when uncontrolled. |
| `draft` | `CreateEventDraft` |  | Controlled draft. |
| `expanded` | `boolean` |  | Controlled expanded state: the same form as a larger centered window. |
| `now` | `UtcInstant` |  | Reference instant for the time-zone offset label. |
| `onDraftChange` | `(draft: CreateEventDraft) => void` |  | Called on every field edit. |
| `onExpandedChange` | `(expanded: boolean) => void` |  | Called when the expand or collapse control is used. |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean) => void` |  | Called on open and close, including after submit and a confirmed discard. |
| `open` | `boolean` |  | Controlled open state. |
| `renderCompactShell` | `(content: ReactNode) => ReactNode` |  | Wraps the compact form content in a host-owned shell instead of the kit popover. |
| `renderError` | `(error: CreateEventSubmitError) => ReactNode` |  | Replaces how a submit error is shown. |
| `renderExpandedShell` | `(content: ReactNode) => ReactNode` |  | Wraps the expanded form content in a host-owned shell instead of the kit dialog. |
| `renderFields` | `() => ReactNode` |  | Extra host fields rendered after the kit's fields. |
| `renderFooter` | `() => ReactNode` |  | Content added above the Cancel/Save row. |
| `renderHeader` | `() => ReactNode` |  | Content added below the header row. |

Also accepts the shared props `direction`, `locale`, `messages`, `t`, `timeZone`, `translations`; see [Internationalization](../../docs/i18n.md#per-component-overrides).

## Behaviour

- The header shows an event-type title (`Event` by default), a slot for host header content, expand/collapse and close icon actions with their accessible labels, and a divider.
- Title, schedule, time range, all-day switch, dates/day count, recurrence, timezone, people, conferencing, location, and description fields update one draft.
- Dates and times use the large icon-left field treatment; the schedule shows its calendar colour as a dot in the selected value and each option, and people tags use stroke tags with dismiss and clear-all actions.
- Timed events leave the end date empty when it is the same as the start date; the day-span indicator is shown only for a positive span.
- Date rows are masked date inputs: the locale's date mask is typed segment by segment and commits as soon as it parses, the calendar button ahead of the value (or `Alt+ArrowDown`) opens a picker whose selection writes the row directly, and the optional end date clears from the trailing clear button.
- The location control starts as a secondary `Add a location` action and opens the injected location combobox when requested.
- The people and location comboboxes use the shared 36px form-field skin; selected people use 24px removable chips inside the same form-layer frame.
- Timed and all-day ranges are validated by the React-free core helper before `onSubmit` runs. The Save action is disabled while the draft is invalid or submitting.
- Repeat offers Does not repeat, Daily, Weekly, Biweekly, Monthly, Yearly and Custom. The Custom option's label never changes, whatever rule it holds.
- Custom opens an anchored 406×325 card beside the Repeat field. Every change is written to the draft immediately as an RFC 5545 rule body such as `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE`; Back or the close button only closes the card. Weekday choices are toggle buttons in display order; `Ends: Never` omits an end and `Ends: On` appends `UNTIL=YYYYMMDD`.
- A one-line summary under the Repeat field describes the current rule for every choice, for example "Repeats every 2 weeks on Tuesday and Thursday until Wed, Sep 30, 2026". "Does not repeat" shows no summary.
- A pending submit disables duplicate attempts. A host error is rendered without closing the form.
- A clean cancel closes immediately. A dirty cancel opens an alert dialog with keep-editing and discard actions; the confirmation and custom-repeat layer are mounted in the active create shell so they overlay that popover, and confirmed discard closes the parent form.
- `renderHeader`, `renderFields`, `renderFooter`, `renderError`, and shell render props provide host composition without app imports.

All labels come from `t`; `locale`, `timeZone`, `direction`, and `now` are presentation inputs. When `now` is omitted, the time-zone label follows the wall clock. The title is plain text, and the kit does not invent an event-type data contract.
