/**
 * MFE Bootstrap
 *
 * Registers the domains the host implements and the extensions of the MFE
 * manifests with the FrontX app.
 *
 * MFE manifest configs are fetched at runtime from `generated-mfe-manifests.json`
 * in the shell's own folder (`manifestsUrl`), a public asset produced by
 * `scripts/generate-mfe-manifests.ts` before each `vite dev` / `vite build`. The
 * JSON shape is identical to what the future backend API will return so the
 * transport swap is a one-line URL change here.
 *
 * A screen's `publicPath` in the file may be relative: the production layout
 * (`scripts/layout-dist.ts`) writes `mfe/<package>/`. The MFE handler resolves
 * it against the document, which the shell is served as from its own folder,
 * the folder the file sits in. The entries are registered exactly as the file
 * carries them, so every runtime that registers them from the same file (a
 * nested app's own bootstrap included) registers the same content.
