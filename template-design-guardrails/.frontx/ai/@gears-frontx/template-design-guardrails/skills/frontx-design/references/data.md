# Data display and dashboards

## Start with a decision

Every metric or table answers one of: what changed, is action needed, where
is the problem, who owns the next step, what evidence supports the
conclusion. A metric that serves no decision and routes to no evidence goes
(DAT-001).

## KPI anatomy

A KPI set shares one anatomy: label; value and unit; timeframe or comparison
basis; delta or status when it means something; drill-down. The value is a
kit type role, not decoration (APP-002, `references/app-screens.md`).
Numbers in one family share baseline, size and format, and the value sits at
the same height in every widget.

## Charts

- The title states the metric, not the chart type; time range and
  aggregation are visible; axes, units, zero baseline and comparison basis
  are explicit where they change the reading.
- Hover detail also works by keyboard on interactive points; interactive
  charts have a table or text alternative (DAT-003).
- Direct labels before distant legends when space allows; area fills are
  translucent and below the line; notable points, current value and target
  are marked.
- No donut when a proportion bar or a count says it more directly.
- Palettes are in `references/color.md`.

## Status distributions

Segmented bars use proportional lengths, thin geometry and small or no gaps
as the kit pattern draws them; legend order matches segment order; legend
values align and share a number format; total and denominator are visible.
No thick rounded segments that look like pills.

## Source or system health

Show the healthy over total count once; source name, state and last update
in stable columns; keep the last trustworthy sync value on failure; a small
semantic cue plus state text, not a unique icon per source.

## Timelines

Milestones share one horizontal scale; completed, current, blocked and
future states have consistent geometry and cues; labels stay with their
markers; a blocked gate names blocker and owner, a future gate its condition
or date. Gantt-style views show the time scale, the today marker,
dependencies when drawn and a non-drag way to change things.

## Tables

Table anatomy is in `references/components.md`. For data:

- keep the primary entity and its state easy to scan; put type under the
  primary label when a type column fights for width;
- plain status text with a small dot where a chip adds weight;
- long evidence goes to an inspector, with a short link or count in the row;
- taller readable rows before tiny type and crowded columns; headers align
  with their cells.

## Dashboard grid

- Two widget widths, half and full (`widgetSpans`); thirds only for parallel
  KPI cards with identical anatomy (`thirdsPolicy`), both in
  `rules/layout-contract.json`.
- Equal-width widgets in one row share height and internal baselines.
- Full width is for a relationship, sequence, table or issue list that needs
  it.

## Data honesty

No score without a formula or a route to its parts; no trend without
timeframe and basis; no status without a threshold or evidence; no precision
the source does not have. Partial, stale and estimated data **MUST** be
marked.
