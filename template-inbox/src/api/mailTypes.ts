 * Mail domain - API response contracts.
 *
 * A sibling of `types.ts`, not an extension of it: mail shares no collection
 * with the chat/contacts domain, so it gets its own contracts, its own
 * dataset and its own service (`MailApiService`) rather than a new field
 * bolted onto `Conversation`. See `InboxApiService`'s own doc comment for
 * when the split the other way - one service over one dataset - is the right
 * call; here the two domains do not overlap at all.
 *
 * Every shape here crosses the mock boundary as JSON, same constraint as
 * `types.ts`: no `Date`, no `Map`, no method on any field.
