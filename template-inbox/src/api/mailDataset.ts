/**
 * Mail domain - the seeded content, and the only module that holds any.
 *
 * Same discipline as `dataset.ts`: imported by `mailMocks.ts` alone, instants
 * are offsets back from the shared anchor in `seedClock.ts` so the list keeps
 * reading "1h" and "2d" on any run day, and every mailbox count downstream is
 * computed from `mails` rather than stored on a row - see `mailSelectors.ts`.
 *
 * 13 mails across the five mailboxes this product ships (no Spam): 6 Inbox,
 * 2 Drafts, 2 Sent, 2 Archive, 1 Trash. Three are unread, all in Inbox -
 * unread is an Inbox-only concept here, so a sent or archived message is
 * never "unread". Two carry history: `ml-2` and `ml-11`, each with two earlier
 * messages in `mailMessages` behind the reading pane's toggle.
