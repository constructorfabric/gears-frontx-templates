 * Dashboard domain - API response contracts.
 *
 * A sibling of `mailTypes.ts`: its own domain, its own dataset, its own
 * service (`DashboardApiService`). One screen shows one coherent picture, so
 * unlike the mail/inbox split this domain answers through a single endpoint
 * (`getDashboard`) rather than one per section - see `DashboardApiService`'s
 * own doc comment.
 *
 * Every shape here crosses the mock boundary as JSON, same constraint as
 * `types.ts`: no `Date`, no `Map`, no method on any field. Every number a
 * screen displays is either a field here or an arithmetic result computed
 * from one at render - nothing is hardcoded in a component.
