 * shared anchor in `seedClock.ts`, so the activity table keeps reading
 * "2h ago" on any run day. The activity rows point at the inbox dataset's
 * contacts (`contactId`) rather than inventing a second set of people; the
 * mock map hands those ids to `createActivity`, so this module imports no
 * other dataset.
 *
 * Every number a card displays is either read straight from a field here or
 * computed from one (a sum, an average, a delta) in the screen that renders
 * it - nothing is hardcoded in a component.
