/**
 * Where the app is, held in the URL fragment.
 *
 * Five routes: `#/dashboard`, `#/chat`, `#/mail`, `#/contacts`,
 * `#/contacts/{id}`. The fragment rather than the path because a fragment
 * needs no server rewrite - a seeded project can serve the built
 * `index.html` from any static host and every deep link still resolves,
 * including the one a "View contact" click writes.
 *
 * A router library would earn its weight at the point this app has nested
 * layouts or loaders to express. With five routes and no nesting it would be a
 * dependency to explain rather than a problem solved, so the parse below is the
 * whole thing and stays replaceable: swap this module and the `navigate`
 * call sites, and nothing in the screens changes.
