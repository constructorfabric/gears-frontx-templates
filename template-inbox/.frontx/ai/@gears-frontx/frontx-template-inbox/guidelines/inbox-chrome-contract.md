# Guideline: The App's Chrome, and What a New Screen Plugs Into

This application owns its whole document. There is no host to ask for anything,
so every mechanism below is a module in `src/app/` that a screen simply calls.
Reuse them; do not write a second copy of any of them.

## The icon rail is the navigation

`src/app/IconRail.tsx` is the app's fixed 64px left edge: the product mark at
the top, one button per section, a flexible spacer, then the theme toggle and
the profile-menu popover at the bottom. Adding a section means adding a button
there and a branch in `src/app/App.tsx` - there is no manifest, no extension
declaration and no id taxonomy.

The rail never collapses. It is the edge the rest of the layout is measured
from; the folder and filter columns beside it are the ones that collapse.

The dashboard is the one screen with no folder/filter column at all - it is a
single full-width, scrollable pane straight after the rail. Not every screen
needs a secondary sidebar; add one only when the screen actually has a
folder/filter concept to hold, the way chat and mail do.

## Routing is the URL fragment

`src/app/routing.ts` owns five routes and the parser for them:

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `#/dashboard` | the dashboard - the default for any unrecognised address, including a stale `#/inbox` link |
| `#/chat` | the chat screen |
| `#/mail` | the mail screen |
| `#/contacts` | the contacts directory |
| `#/contacts/{id}` | one contact's page |

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **A section's own sub-state that a visitor could want to return to belongs in
  the route, not in screen state.** A contact's page is a route for exactly that
  reason: "View contact" in a thread is `navigate(contactRoute(id))`, and the
  address it produces reloads, bookmarks and shares.
- **The fragment, not the path.** A fragment needs no server rewrite, so the
  built `index.html` deep-links correctly from any static host. Adding a route
  means extending `parseRoute` and its test, not adding a router.

## Theme is one attribute

`src/app/theme.ts` sets `data-theme` on the document root and mirrors it to
`localStorage`; `@gears-frontx/ui-kit/theme.css` repaints every token from that
attribute. The app is dark-first, and `index.html` already ships
`data-theme="dark"` so the first paint is dark before any script runs -
`applyStoredTheme()` in `src/main.tsx` then corrects it for a visitor who chose
light, before the first render.

A screen never reads or writes the theme. `useTheme` exists for the one toggle
in the rail.

## Copy

`src/app/i18n.ts` exports `t`, reading `src/i18n/en.json`. Screens take `t` as a
prop rather than importing it, which is what keeps them renderable in a test
with `t = (key) => key`. Add a screen's strings to that one file.

## Kit overlays need nothing

Select, Popover, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip and Sheet portal to `<body>`,
which is this app's own document. Pass no `container`.

## Styles

Kit component CSS travels with each component the bundler pulls in; there is
nothing to import. The app's own layout lives in
`src/styles/workspace.module.css`, written entirely in kit tokens - no raw
colour, no raw metric, no CSS framework. `src/styles/app.css` is the document
frame alone (full height, no page scroll) and should not grow. The dashboard
is the one screen with a CSS module of its own, `src/styles/dashboard.module.css`
- its grid composition and its KPI/hero/chip type scale are specific enough to
that one screen that folding them into the shared file would only add classes
nothing else reads. A future screen with a similarly self-contained layout can
follow the same split; a screen that reuses the existing pane/header/sidebar
shapes should keep reading `workspace.module.css` instead of starting a new
file.

## Chrome as shipped

A screen added later should keep these as they are.

1. The rail's mark is a neutral helpdesk glyph.
2. Only the sections this app ships appear in the rail; the out-of-scope ones
   are absent (see the `inbox-scope-inventory` guideline).
3. The palette is the kit's tokens.
4. The rail's bottom cluster is the theme toggle and the profile menu, nothing
   else: no command palette, messenger settings, settings or theme customiser.
5. Profile, Settings and Log out in the profile menu are inert.
6. The panes collapse for tablet and phone widths; the rail keeps its shape at
   every width.
