/**
 * demo-mfe widgets-host lifecycle.
 *
 * Constructs a nested FrontX app that owns the widgets ExtensionDomain (per
 * Phase 1.5 audit Q5 single-owner rule). The widgets domain GTS instance is
 * authored inside `demo-mfe/mfe.json`'s `domains[]` array — content-addressed
 * by its GTS instance ID and registered into the nested type system from the
 * global runtime-fetched manifest. TypeScript transports the entity, never
 * defines it.
 *
 * Discovery follows the Phase 5.6 runtime-fetch contract: this nested app
 * fetches the same `generated-mfe-manifests.json` the host bootstrap fetches.
 * For each MFE package in the global manifest, schemas / manifest / domains /
 * entries are registered opaquely on the nested type system (Phase 6.7 order:
 * schemas → manifest → domains → entries → extensions). The widgets domain
 * instance is located in the registered domains by its GTS instance ID, then
 * the nested app takes ownership via `registry.registerDomain(domain, factory)`.
 * Extensions whose `domain` matches the widgets domain are registered opaquely
 * on the nested registry. No build-time imports of foreign-package mfe.json
 * files, no hardcoded URLs, no GTS-entity decomposition in L4 code.
 *
 * The widgets domain is itself routed (its own flat `route: "widgets"`,
 * admitted by this nested app's own injected `FrameworkRouter` — ADR 0036):
 * `WidgetsHostScreen`'s own domain-slot attach starts that router's observer
 * for this domain, and every settled mount/unmount is reflected into the URL
 * automatically from there, exactly like the shell's own domains — this
 * module builds no routing wiring of its own.

 * Bootstrap demo-mfe's widgets-host child runtime:

 *      type system so derived-schema chains resolve regardless of package
 *      iteration order.
 *   3. Second pass: for each package, register manifest, domains, then
 *      entries opaquely on the child type system (Phase 6.7 order:
 *      schemas → manifest → domains → entries → extensions). While iterating
 *      domains, locate the widgets domain by its GTS instance ID so the
 *      nested app can take ownership of it via `registry.registerDomain(...)`.
 *   4. Take ownership of the widgets domain (registerDomain on the nested
 *      registry, paired with the local `WidgetsDomainFactory`) — skipped when
 *      a cached registry (HMR, a remount) already owns it.
 *   5. Third pass: for each extension whose target domain is the widgets
 *      domain, register it opaquely on the child registry — skipped per
 *      extension already registered.
 *
 * GTS entities flow through unchanged — no spread, no override, no
 * decomposition, no L4 reconstruction. The generation script inlines the
 * resolved `MfManifest` object into each entry's `manifest` field so entries
 * are registered opaquely without any consumer-side spread. The widgets
 * domain instance is authored once in `demo-mfe/mfe.json` (`domains[]`) and
 * arrives here through the same fetched manifest pipeline as every other GTS
 * entity.
 *
 * Returns the located widgets domain declaration so the caller can read its
 * `route` and `defaultActionTimeout` without a second manifest walk.
 *
 * Exported test-only (see `WidgetsRoutingHolder`'s doc comment): production
 * code reaches this only through `DemoMfeWidgetsHostLifecycle.mount()`.
